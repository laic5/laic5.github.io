<p>My name is Cindy Lai and I'm currently in STAT 141b. I'm currently a third year Statistics Major and Computer Science minor. As an aspiring data scientist and statistics student, I wanted to learn more about applied data analysis which is why I took this course. </p>
<p>My interests in the areas of data science include data exploration and machine learning. I started my data science journey in R, but with this course it was my first introduction into python. Within machine learning I enjoy classification and regression</p>
<p>On this site, I will share some of the projects I worked on, and small writeups about exactly what I learned</p>
