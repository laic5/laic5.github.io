<p>Hi! My name is Cindy Lai, and I'm currently a <b>3rd year Stats Major</b> with a CS minor at UC Davis. As an aspiring data scientist, I try to do my best to expose myself to all the little wonders data science has to offer. </p>
<p>My ds interests include <b>data exploration</b> and <b>machine learning</b>. I started my data science journey in R, but now I have ventured out to Python as well.</p>
<p>On this site, I will share some of the projects I worked on, with small writeups about what I learned.</p>
<p><i><b>Questions?</b> Email me at cynthialai1996 at gmail dot com!</i></p>
